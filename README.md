To Do List
========

A To Do List program that allows a user to enter tasks onto a to-do list.
Built during the first days of learning Object Oriented design in JavaScript, so this project is unfinished.
Some code was written and subsequently commented out for a future feature: creating and adding tasks to specific lists.
Program built with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
